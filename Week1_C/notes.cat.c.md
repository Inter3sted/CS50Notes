# notes_meow.c

> A beginner-friendly, fully commented C program that prints "meow" a number of times. It includes explanations of function prototypes, loops, user input with CS50, and why `do...while` is used for input validation.

---

## How to Compile & Run

**Prerequisite:** Assumes the [CS50 Library](https://cs50.readthedocs.io/library/c/) for C is installed.

**Compile:**
```bash
clang -std=c11 -Wall -Wextra -Werror notes_meow.c -lcs50 -o notes_meow
````

**Run:**

```bash
./notes_meow
```

-----

## Key Concepts üí°

  * **Function Prototypes**: Declarations that tell the compiler about a function's name, return type, and parameters *before* it's used. This allows you to define functions after `main()` or in other files.

      * **Example:** `void meow(int n);`
      * **Meaning:** "There is a function named `meow` that takes one `int` argument and returns nothing (`void`)."

  * **`main()`**: The program's required entry point‚Äîexecution always begins here.

  * **Loops**:

      * **`for` loop**: `for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) { ... }` ‚Äî Best for iterating a known number of times.
      * **`while` loop**: `while (condition) { ... }` ‚Äî Repeats as long as a condition is true; may not run at all.
      * **`do...while` loop**: `do { ... } while (condition);` ‚Äî Always runs the body **at least once**, then checks the condition to see if it should repeat.

  * **CS50 `get_int()`**: A helpful function from `<cs50.h>` that prompts the user with a string and safely returns an integer.

-----

## Input Validation with `do...while`

We use a `do...while` loop to get user input because we must **prompt the user at least once** *before* we can check if their input is valid.

  * A `do...while` loop runs the code in the `do { ... }` block first, and *then* checks the `while (condition)`. This is perfect for input validation.
  * A regular `while (condition) { ... }` loop checks the condition first. This is a problem if the variable hasn't been given a value yet (it holds a "garbage" value), leading to unpredictable behavior.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Memory Safety: The Danger of Uninitialized Variables

Reading a variable before you've assigned it a value is **undefined behavior** in C. The program might crash, or it might *seem* to work sometimes and fail unexpectedly at others.

**Bad Example (Undefined Behavior):**

```c
int n; // n is uninitialized (holds a random "garbage" value)

// This checks the garbage value of n BEFORE we get input from the user!
while (n < 1)
{
    n = get_int("Number: ");
}
```

**Good Example (Correct & Safe):**

```c
int n; // n is uninitialized, but that's okay here.

do
{
    // We get input and assign a value to n FIRST.
    n = get_int("Number: ");
}
// THEN we check the condition. The value of n is now defined and predictable.
while (n < 1);
```

## Final Code: `notes_meow.c`

```c
#include <cs50.h>   // Allows get_int()
#include <stdio.h>  // Allows printf()

/*
 * FUNCTION PROTOTYPE:
 * Tell the compiler that a function named `meow` exists below,
 * takes an int parameter `n`, and returns nothing (void).
 */
void meow(int n);

/* MAIN: Program entry point */
int main(void)
{
    // We need a positive integer from the user.
    int n;

    // do...while guarantees we prompt at least once.
    // We keep asking until n >= 1.
    do
    {
        n = get_int("Number: "); // Example input: 3
    }
    while (n < 1); // If user typed 0 or negative, ask again.

    // Now print "meow" exactly n times.
    meow(n);

    return 0; // Return 0 signals success.
}

/*
 * FUNCTION DEFINITION:
 * Prints "meow\n" exactly n times using a for loop.
 */
void meow(int n)
{
    // Start i at 0; continue while i < n; increment i each loop.
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        printf("meow\n");
    }
}
```

## Appendix: Alternate Implementations

These examples are for learning and show different ways to achieve the same result (e.g., printing "meow" 3 times).

#### Method 1: Manual `printf`

Repetitive and not scalable, but it works for a fixed number.

```c
printf("meow\n");
printf("meow\n");
printf("meow\n");
```

#### Method 2: `while` loop (count down)

```c
int i = 3;
while (i > 0)
{
    printf("meow\n");
    i--;
}
```

#### Method 3: `for` loop (classic)

This is the most common and idiomatic way to loop a specific number of times in C.

```c
for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
{
    printf("meow\n");
}
```

#### Earlier Version A: Function with no parameters

The `main` function is responsible for looping and calls a simple `meow` function multiple times.

```c
// prototype
void meow(void);

int main(void)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++)
    {
        meow();
    }
    return 0;
}

void meow(void)
{
    printf("meow\n");
}
```

#### Earlier Version B: Function with a parameter

`main` passes the desired count to the function, making the `meow` function more reusable and powerful. This is the design used in the final program.

```c
// prototype
void meow(int n);

int main(void)
{
    meow(3);
    return 0;
}

void meow(int n)
{
    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    {
        printf("meow\n");
    }
}
```
# Data Types and Variables
### `int`
- Stores integers.
- Always takes **4 bytes (32 bits)**.
- Range: `-2^31` to `2^31 - 1`.
### `unsigned int`
- Qualifier that disallows negative values.
- Doubles the positive range compared to `int`.
- Occasionally used in CS50.
### `char`
- Stores **single characters**.
- Always **1 byte (8 bits)**.
- Range: `-128` to `127`.
- Uses **ASCII mapping** to represent characters like `A`, `B`, `C`.

### `float`
- Stores **floating-point values (real numbers)**.
- **4 bytes (32 bits)**.
- Limited precision.

### `double`
- Stores **floating-point values** with **double precision**.
- **8 bytes (64 bits)**.
- Allows more precise real numbers than `float`.

### `void`
- Not a data type, but a **type specifier**.
- Functions can have:
  - `void` return type ‚Üí return nothing.
  - `void` parameter list ‚Üí takes no parameters.
- Think of it as "nothing."

### `bool`
- Stores **Boolean values**: `true` or `false`.
- Requires `#include <cs50.h>`.

### `string`
- Stores words, sentences, and text.
- Requires `#include <cs50.h>`.

## Creating Variables

    - To create, specify data type of variables and give a name
    int number;
    char letter;
    - if wish to create multiple of same type, specify name once, then list as many as you want
    int height, width;
    float sqrt2, sqrt3, pi;
    - In general, good practice to declare variables when needed.
Using variables
    - After variable **declared**, it's no longer necessary to specify variables type. (In fact, doing that leads to unintended consequences)
    int number; // declaration
    number = 17; // assignment
    char letter; // declaration
    letter = 'H'; // assignment
    - if declaring and setting value of a variable (sometimes called **initializing**), you can consolidate to one step.
    int number = 17; // initialization
    char letter = 'H'; // initialization

## Arithmetic Operators
    - In C we add (+), subtract (-), multiply (*) and divide (/) numbers.
    int x = y + 1;
    x = x * 5;
    - We also have modulus operator, (%) which gives us remainder when number on left of operator is divided by number on right.
    int m = 13 % 4; // m is now 1
    - C provides shorthand way to apply arithmetic operator.
    x = x * 5;
    x *= 5;
    - This works with all five basic arithmetic operators. C provides further shorthand for increments or decrements of a variable by 1:
    x++;
    x--;
## Boolean Expressions
    - Boolean expressions are for comparing values in C
    - All expressions in C are either True or False
    - Result of Boolean expression in other progreamming constructs such as deciding which branch in a **conditional** to take, or determining whether a **loop** should continue to run.
    - Sometimes when using Bool expressions we use variables of type bool, but we don't have to.
    - In C, every nonzero value is true, and zero is false.
    Two main types of Bool expressions: **logical operators** an **relational operators**.
- Logical operators
    - Logical AND (&&) is true if and only if both operands are true, otherwise false
    x true y true (x&&y) true, x true y false (x&&y) false
- Logical Operators
    - Logical OR (||) is true if and only if at least one operand is true, otherwise false. x true y true (x||y) true, x true y false (x||y) true, x false y false (x||y) false.
    - Logical NOT (!) inverts the value of its operand. x true !x false, x false !x true.
- Relational operators
    - These behave as you would expect them to, and appear syntactically similar to how you may recall them from elementary arithmetic.
        - Less than (x < y)
        - Less than or equal to (x <= y)
        - Greater than (x > y)
        - Greater than or equal to (x >= y)
    - C also tests two variables for equality or inequality
        - Equality (x == y)
        - Inequality (x != y)
    - It's a common mistake to use the assignment operator (=) when you intend to use the equality operator (==).
# Conditionals

- Conditional expressions allow your programs to make decisions and take different forks in the road, depending on the values of variables or user input.  
- C provides a few different ways to implement conditional expressions (also known as branches) in your programs, some of which likely look familiar from Scratch.  

---

## `if` Statements

```
if (boolean-expression) {
    // code runs if expression is true
}
```
- If the boolean-expression evaluates to true, all lines of code between the curly braces will execute in order from top-to-bottom.
- If the boolean-expression evaluates to false, those lines of code will not execute.

### if ... else
```
if (boolean-expression) {
    // first branch
} else {
    // second branch
}
```
- If the boolean-expression is true, the first branch executes.
- If it‚Äôs false, the second branch executes.

### if ... else if ... else
```
if (boolean-expr1) {
    // first branch
} else if (boolean-expr2) {
    // second branch
} else if (boolean-expr3) {
    // third branch
} else {
    // fourth branch
}
```
- In C, it is possible to create an if ‚Äì else if ‚Äì else chain.
- In Scratch, this required nesting blocks.
- Each branch is mutually exclusive.

### Non-Mutually Exclusive ifs
```
if (boolean-expr1) {
    // first branch
}
if (boolean-expr2) {
    // second branch
}
if (boolean-expr3) {
    // third branch
} else {
    // fourth branch
}
```
- It is also possible to create a chain of non-mutually exclusive branches.
- In this example, only the third and fourth branches are mutually exclusive. The else binds to the nearest if only.

### switch Statements
```
int x = GetInt();
switch(x) {
    case 1: printf("One!\n"); 
            break; 
    case 2: printf("Two!\n"); 
            break; 
    case 3: printf("Three!\n"); 
            break; 
    default: printf("Sorry!\n");
}
```
- C‚Äôs switch() statement is a conditional statement that permits enumeration of discrete cases, instead of relying on Boolean expressions.
- It‚Äôs important to break; between each case, or you will ‚Äúfall through‚Äù each case (unless that is desired).

### Example of Fallthrough
```
int x = GetInt(); 
switch(x) { 
    case 5: printf("Five, "); 
    case 4: printf("Four, "); 
    case 3: printf("Three, "); 
    case 2: printf("Two, "); 
    case 1: printf("One, "); 
    default: printf("Blastoff!\n"); 
}
```
= Without break;, execution ‚Äúfalls through‚Äù into subsequent cases until a break or the end of the switch.

### Ternary Operator ?:
```
int x;
if (expr) {
    x = 5;  
} else {
    x = 6; 
}
and

int x = (expr) ? 5 : 6;
```
- These two snippets of code act identically.
- The ternary operator (?:) is mostly a shorthand trick, but useful for writing trivially short conditional branches.
- Be familiar with it, but you don‚Äôt need to use it unless you want to.

## Summary
if (and if-else, and if-else if-‚Ä¶-else)
Use Boolean expressions to make decisions.

switch
Use discrete cases to make decisions.

?: (ternary operator)
Use to replace a very simple if-else to make your code look concise.
